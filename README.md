# Project Proposal
## Project title
Lab Participants Management System

## What and why?
In nowadays labs (especially psychology labs), managing experiment participants could be very complex. Therefore, a system that could enable lab managers to manage participants, follow their current status, make payments to them, and contact them easily would be very helpful to reduce the non-necessary administrative work for them so that they don't mess things up and save more time for meaningful works.

## For whom?
For (university) lab manager and staff members to manage lab participants. Also, for participants to register, receive important instruction, receive payment, and contact the lab easily.

## How?
As lab managers or staff, they should be able to add participants to the system with detailed information manually. They should be able to change the status and appointment of the participants at any time. They should be able to send messages and reminders to them easily. They should be able to make payments online. They should be able to assign participants to a specific project and assign a particular lab member to follow up.
As lab participants, they should be able to register, make, or cancel the appointment. They should be able to sign the consent form online. They should be able to message lab members easily. They should be able to provide their payment information online.

## Scope
This is a project that is flexible to its scope. The basic components would not consume much time and work. However, there could be a lot of additional features building upon it. In this way, the team has the flexibility to define the complexity of this project to some extent.
